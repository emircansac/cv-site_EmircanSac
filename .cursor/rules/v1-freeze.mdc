# v1 Interaction Freeze Rule (ALWAYS)

v1 interaction logic is frozen.

DO NOT:
- Refactor or simplify scroll / wheel routing logic
- Change navigation timing, cooldowns, or burst-gate behavior
- Modify nav-mode (card ↔ section) state transitions

Reason:
Current complexity is intentional, evidence-backed, and validated
against real trackpad momentum and rapid input.

Allowed in v1:
- Comments and documentation
- TODO notes explicitly marked for v2
- Non-interaction-related changes

Any interaction behavior change belongs to v2 only.
